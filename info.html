    <p id="p">&emsp;In the above picture you can notice the differences in words
        over time as English progressed and evolved as a language. English has changed 
        an enormous amount over this period of time, from new words from other languages 
        being adopted, to some words changing in meaning, to even large word order and 
        grammatical changes. English is typically defined by these three major periods due 
        to the rapid change taking place within the language from the 12th to 15th century. 
        Old English is thought to have been defined by the settling of the first Anglo-Saxon 
        peoples in what is now considered England.<br><br><br>

    <h3>Old English and Middle English</h3>

    <p id="p">&emsp;English at this time still retained many elements from its Germanic roots, 
        but was at least partially initially influenced in several ways by the existing Celtic 
        peoples in the area at the time. "Beowulf" is a famous example of a work we have written 
        in Old English. Below you can see a small piece of Old English and its translation. The "æ" 
        character can be thought of as the sound of the letter A in the word "at." The "þ" and "ð" 
        are both used depending on context for the two respective sounds we have in English 
        currently for the "th" combination of letters (like the "th" in "the" and the "th" in 
        "breath"). The grammar of Old English also contained elements not seen in grammar in modern 
        English, like 3 grammatical genders for nouns and agreeing adjectives, and also different 
        forms of nouns depending on the various roles they play in the sentence. Verb conjugations 
        also generally had more forms than we know today.

    <p id="p">&emsp;During the period of Old English, two separate groups at different times 
        invaded and influenced the language in different ways. The first were Scandinavian and 
        spoke Old Norse, which is considered a North Germanic language and is the precursor to 
        languages such as Norwegian and Icelandic. They altered the language in numerous ways, 
        including "simplifying" the grammar by reducing the forms of verbs. The second group 
        were from modern day northern France and spoke Old French, and contributed a great deal 
        to the current vocabulary of Modern English along with other changes. This occupation took
        place during the end of Old English throughout Middle english. When the ties were severed 
        with northern France in the beginning of the 13th Century, the nobility in England gradually 
        became English and English speaking, but before this period French was considered the 
        language of nobility and English was the language for the common people. "The Canterbury Tales" 
        is an example of something written during this time.<br><br><br>

    <h3>Early Modern to Current</h3>

    <p id="p">&emsp;I honestly spent way longer on this than I meant to but I find this topic 
        interesting. I don't want to spend too much more time on this but I will say that this period 
        was the period in which WIlliam Shakespear lived even though he wrote in a higher form of 
        english than was common. This period was marked by British colonialism and also the Great Vowel 
        Shift, which was a period between Old and Middle English in which the sounds of vowels changed 
        at a much faster rate due to various factors. This was also during the time of the introduction 
        of the printing press, which along with the Great Vowel Shift and several other factors is why 
        the Modern English language contains so many inconsistencies in spelling and pronunciations. It 
        basically came down to an incredibly small number of people deciding the fate of the written English 
        language due to them owning the first commercial printing presses. This is why there are so many 
        inconsistencies in the written form. One of my favorites is that the words island and isle 
        actually don't even share the same etymology, but were made to be spelled similarly due to the whims
        of those deciding how to spell words in the first commercial publications and the similarities in 
        how the two words sounded in a few dialects at the time. Island is derived from the Old English 
        "Igland," while isle is derived from Old French "Ile."
