    <p class="p">&emsp;I wanted to make a simple website briefly summarizing the differences
        between Modern English and its earlier forms, and perhaps briefly touch on the 
        circumstances leading to these changes. English as we currently know it has been 
        influenced in many different ways over the last roughly 1500 or more years, from 
        when it was considered to have been initially distinguished as its own separate 
        language to now what we see in the modern era. Pictured below is the rough 
        timeline of English as it has progressed through different stages characterized 
        by unique distinctions between them. I will try to not get too carried away and will
        make as brief as I can, which will probably lead to explanations being at times 
        unsatisfactory. EDIT: Okay so I'm breaking the third wall or whatever and coming 
        back to this paragraph to say that wow I spent so much time on this and still felt 
        like I want to say way more and offer much better explanations to things. Also I 
        didn't put any sources down <s>because I made everything up</s> actually just 
        because the information within the site wasn't the actual focus of this project.

        &emsp;The english language as we know it is a Germanic language specifically within the 
        West Germanic language family, along with other major languages such as German and 
        Dutch. The Germanic languages all originated in a proto language we now refer to as 
        Proto-Germanic. This proto language has several key features, like sounds and 
        sound changes over time, that distinguish it from its parent language; another 
        proto language referred to today as Proto-Indo-European. <br><br><br>
